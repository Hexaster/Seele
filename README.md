My name is Andrew, a new student at ANU. I just learnt Java last semester, and somehow there was a whim in my mind:
What if I build a neural network through Java on my own?
So here it is, my own deep learning model Seele. I designed it on my own 
from mathematical operations to the whole structure 
of network and finished it with
the least libraries as I can. I got help from the list below:
* ArrayList
* HashMap
* Optional
* Collections
* Random

I imitated the structure of Pytorch while they 
are not exactly same. Please note that Seele is just a simple project of a
student in which robustness and optimisation are ignored. Furthermore, I only did very limit simple tests, so the reliance of such a model is not
guaranteed.

If you have good suggestions, please feel free to contact me through:
lagrangedoge3@gmail.com, give me your suggestion, teach me why I need to do that,
thank you.
