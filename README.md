# Seele -- A simple Java-based Neural Network Model
Yes, I am playing Honkai Star Rail.

My name is Andrew, a new student at ANU. I just learnt Java last semester, and somehow a thought struck me: "What if I build a neural network with Java on my own?"

So here it is, my own deep learning model Seele. I designed it on my own from mathematical operations to the whole structure of the network and finished it using the least number of libraries as I could. I used the following:
* ArrayList
* HashMap
* Optional
* Collections
* Random

I imitated the structure of Pytorch while they 
are not exactly same. Please note that Seele is just a rudimentary project of a
student in which robustness and optimisation are ignored. Furthermore, I only did very limit simple tests, so the reliance of such a model is not
guaranteed.

If you have good suggestions, please feel free to contact me at: lagrangedoge3@gmail.com. I appreciate your feedback and I'm open to learning new things. Thank you.
